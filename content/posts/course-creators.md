Here's the 3 C's I try to follow:

- Create
- Convert
- Complete

That is, I want to *create* better courses, I want to help them *covert* better (ie convince more people it's worth their time), and, most important, help others *complete* their courses more often.

Below are some course creators I find inspiration from but I do not necessarily endorse the quality of their content. I think there is a *lot* to learn from what others do well *as well* as what they can improve on.
