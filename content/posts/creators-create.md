I've made over 2,000 lessons in my career. That's 2,000+ videos ranging from 3 minutes to 25 minutes teach others how to do something. And I've barely scratched the surface of what I will create. 

I don't tell you this to brag, not at all. 

I tell you to remind you, that creating videos is what I do. I am a creator. 

What you do defines who are you. What you value and believe will guide what you do. 

- To be a creator, you just need to create something. 
- To be a musician, you just need to play something. 
- To be a painter, you just need to paint something. 
- To be an accountant, you just need to count something. Haha!

If you believe you're a painter and you don't paint, I hate to break it to you but you're not a painter... yet. Replace painter with nearly any other profession and/or hobby. 

Being comes after the doing the work. Believing you can do something is much different then believing you are. Just because you believe you're a creator doesn't make you one until you start creating. 

I am a creator therefore I create things is backward. 

- I create things therefore I am a creator. 
- I code things therefore I am a coder. 
- I teach things therefore I am a student. 

Doing is the key. This key is unlocked by even the smallest act of doing every day for as long as you can. Thinking you *can* do the thing is essential to continue to do the thing. 

*Just do the thing*
