I want to change this website so it's much more modern but still mostly a blog. 

First, I think moving it to a modern stack that runs on cloudflare would be ideal but overall still "fetching" the markdown files from github to build into the result. Not sure if that's the right way to put it but I want to author blog posts using markdown without needing a backend.
