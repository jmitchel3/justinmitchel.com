read over @strategy.md and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: positioning, strategy, technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious

be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then update the strategy.md file
