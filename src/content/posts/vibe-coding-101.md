Vibe coding = ai codes for you. Let's go deeper.

Early LLMs generated a lot of sloppy and unusable code. It was code that couldn't be trusted. 

Over time, it got better and better. More trust emerged. 

Now, at the end of 2025, we have LLMs that can generate stellar code that can be trusted. This is, in part, because the LLMs are far better. It's also in part because the concept of AI Agents have emerged.

So what's vibe coding? 

Just telling the AI what you want and letting it rip. Once it's done, you give it a quick glance over, even if you're no idea what actually going on, you let it do more.

You build on "vibes" instead of a real understanding of what's actually going on.

You can imagine it a bit like cooking food with a blindfold on but an elite chef holding your and while another chef calls out what to do.
