For most, Claude Desktop is one of the best ways to use AI on your local computer.

Just download it here:

Claude Desktop also has a "Code" mode (famously known as Claude Code) which is great for doing things with your files on your local computer. In some cases, you can have it write actual software, in other cases it can just review things like what I talk about in the post [Full Send Automation](/posts/full-send-automation).
