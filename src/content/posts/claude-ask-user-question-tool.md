Put simply, it's a way to invoke an interview from claude to you:

Start new claude session:
```bash
claude
```

then use:

```
Review @some-doc.md and use AskUserQuestionTool to ask me questions about it.
```

While the `AskUserQuestionTool` above will work, I typically go a bit more detailed, you can see that in the [Vibe Interview](/posts/vibe-interview) article.
